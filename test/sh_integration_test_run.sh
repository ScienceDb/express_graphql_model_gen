# Intergation-test case creates a docker-compose ambient with three servers
# gql_postgres, gql_science_db_graphql_server and gql_ncbi_sim_srv. By default, after the test run,
# all corresponding images will be completely removed from the docker. However, to speed-up the development
# process it is possible to not remove the selected images. Each of the images that wou prefer to keep alive
# shell be preceeded with the -k or --keep-image key. For example:

#$ npm run test-integration -- -k gql_postgres -k gql_science_db_graphql_server -k gql_ncbi_sim_srv

# Also this script can take an optional  "--run-docker-only" parameter. In this case
# a docker will stay running and no tests will be executed automatically. This mode is useful for
# debugging purposes.
